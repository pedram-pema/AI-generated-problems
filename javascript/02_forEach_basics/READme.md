Exercise Description:

Subject: Transform Array Values

Create a function doubleEvenNumbers that takes in an array of numbers. Your task is to iterate through the array using forEach() and transform values based on a certain criteria. Specifically, you need to double even numbers, while leaving odd numbers unchanged.

For example, given the input array [1, 2, 3, 4], the function should transform and return [1, 4, 3, 8].

Conditions:

Mutate the original array directly instead of returning a new array
Use the forEach() array method to iterate
Check if a number is even using the modulo operator (%)
If the array is empty, simply return the empty array
