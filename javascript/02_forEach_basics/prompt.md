<!-- FIRST PROMPT TO CREATE THE EXERCISE AND TEST SUITE -->

Hello helpful assistant! I'm currently learning JavaScript and I'd like to practice my skills. I am at beginner level. Could you please create a JavaScript exercise for me? The subjects I've currently studied are loops, arrays, functions, conditional if else and logical operators, numbers and pretty much basic stuff. If you are familiar with codewars exercises difficulty level I need some exercises at 8kyu level.

to be clear; I'm looking for an exercise that is of normal difficulty but contains some tricky elements to help me improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript syntax.

for this exercise I need it to be about forEach array method. So I can understand the basics of forEach and it's use case better.

Generate an exercise at tricky level that could challenge me.

Additionally, to help me ensure my solution is correct, could you also provide a set of test cases that I could use to verify my code? Basically, I need your output in form of two files, One the JS file which is the file that I'll be working on, and the other is test suite in spec.js format. Both files must contain export and import keywords so I can test them using npm test. if any other files or code is needed for testing, generate them too.

generate a brief for this exercise you just created with the following layout:

Exercise Description: Subject: Sum of Even Indices Create a function sumEvenIndices that takes in an array of numbers. Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers at even indices (0-based) within the array. For example, given [3, 7, 2, 9, 4, 8], the function should calculate and return the sum of numbers at even indices (3 + 2 + 4 = 9). Conditions: If the array is empty, return 0. If the array has only one element at index 0, return that element.
