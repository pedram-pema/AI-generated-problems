Hello helpful assistant! I'm currently learning JavaScript and I'd like to practice my skills. I am at beginner level. Could you please create a JavaScript exercise for me?
 The subject I want to focus on this time is loops and arrays. I'm looking for an exercise that is of normal difficulty but contains some tricky elements to help me improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript syntax. for example, this is an exercise I've completed on 8kyu level on codewars:

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

Generate an exercise like this but at more tricky level that could challenge me more than this one.

Additionally, to help me ensure my solution is correct, could you also provide a set of test cases that I could use to verify my code? Basically, I need your output in form of two files, One the JS file which is the file that I'll be working on, and the other is test suite in spec.js format. Both files must contain export and import keywords so I can test them using npm test. if any other files or code is needed for testing, generate them too.
 I need you to put  Thanks in advance for your assistance!
