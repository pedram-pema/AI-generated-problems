Exercise Description:
Subject: Sum of Even Indices
Create a function sumEvenIndices that takes in an array of numbers. Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers at even indices (0-based) within the array.

For example, given [3, 7, 2, 9, 4, 8], the function should calculate and return the sum of numbers at even indices (3 + 2 + 4 = 9).

Conditions:

If the array is empty, return 0.
If the array has only one element at index 0, return that element.
